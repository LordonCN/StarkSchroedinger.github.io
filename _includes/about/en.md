It didn't occur to me that someone should notice this little space. Anyway, since you are here, why not have a cup of tea.

Hi, I am Felix Zhang. I am a Chinese who have lived in China and Europe. You probably noticed that I did not mention a specific country in Europe, that's becuase I traveled a lot of places and did not settle down.

As my posts suggest, I am quite into C++. Generally, my research of interests include Computer Vision(that's a huge topic!), SLAM and Deep Learning(like everyone else in this world...). I plan to take a PhD but haven't made any agreement with any Professor. If you happened to be a Professor in the related area and are interested in me,	 pffffplease wake me up.

Anyway, I still wish you a great time here, for whatever purposes.
