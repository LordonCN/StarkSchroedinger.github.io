It didn't occur to me that someone should notice this little hidden space. Anyway, since you are here, why not have a cup of tea.

I am a big fan of Harry Potter and Marvel movies, so in my blogs you can easily find many interesting pictures on these two topics. Btw, I have read the Harry Potter books for over eight times but there is still a lot fun to discover. 

As my posts suggest, I am quite into C++, but during the research and daily work, I use python primarily. For me, C++ is like a transparent plastic bottle, each and every detail being displayed in it. Theoretically, you can manipulate this language and design your program with the most flexibility. That's where the beauty of programming lies, I suppose. 

I am joining Professor Sijia Liu's group at MSU in the coming fall in 2021 and I will work on adversarial machine learning and safe AI!

Anyway, I wish you have a great time here for whatever purposes. You are welcome to drop me a message with this [address](zhangyihua2020@outlook.com). Wish you safe through the pandemic.
